# Realtime-Fake-Face-Detection
Developed a Realtime Fake Face Detection System using a custom dataset comprising 7,000 images, evenly split between 3,500 real and 3,500 synthetic faces. Leveraging the YOLOv8 model for object detection, I adapted it to effectively classify images into real and fake categories.

To ensure robust model performance, I implemented a strategic data splitting approach, allocating 70% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. Throughout the project, I utilized powerful libraries such as OpenCV and Ultralytics, training the model over 250 epochs to optimize accuracy while addressing challenges related to overfitting and underfitting.
